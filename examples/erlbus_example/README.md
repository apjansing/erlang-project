# Erlbus Example
This is an attempt to use `rebar3` for the first time and do something non-trival with Erlang. Since Erlang is a language that has historically been used for telecommunications, I decided to attempt to make a basic chat application.

## Running erlbus_example.erl
```
erlc erlbus_example.erl
```

More instruction to come.
