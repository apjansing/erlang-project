# Programming Languages: Erlang Project
This repository is a place to hold my progress on my class project. For this project, I have decided to experiment with creating an Erlang web app. The application might not do anything to interesting, but to start the application hosts my github portfolio webpage and has an endpoint to displays "Hello, World!"

Now go to the [example](examples/web_server) and follow along!
